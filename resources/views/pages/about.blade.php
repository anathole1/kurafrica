            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction” John Crosby, “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn” Benjamin Franklin “Children must be taught how to think, not what to think.” Margaret Mead.
KURAFRIKA is a social enterprise designed with a set of tools, resources and practical sessions for children to develop their thinking capacity and help them to stick and stay focused on their dreams as well as enhancing their learning quality, competence, performance and effectiveness in their studies through self-learning. 
We provide professional mentorship and coaching to children, lending books and internships. Through empathy and effective communication, we guide and advise our mentees  to the path of their dreams in childhood and encourage them to be who they are and know their worth and value. We connect them with experts in different fields to get inspiration thus helping them to set goals and stay determined.  

            </p>
            <h3>Why we work?</h3>
            <p>We strive to identify, guide and address the unnoticed talents and dreams of children as well as providing professional coaching packages  to bring about smartness, competence and unambiguity in children.
